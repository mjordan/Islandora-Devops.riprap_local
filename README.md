## Overview

Ansible role that installs Riprap in the Islandora Playbook.

Still a work in progress, build fails.

This role is based on https://github.com/roblib/Islandora-Devops.riprap (forked at commit d9e5400753f64297494b02e9f6764afe3da884ad) from the University of Prince Edward Island. It differs from UPEI's role in that it installs Riprap in "local" mode and not as an HTTP microservice.
